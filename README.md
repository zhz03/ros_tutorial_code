# ros_tutorial_code

In this tutorial, you'll learn: 

- 01_ros_basic
- 02_rostopics
- 03_ros_param_launch_bag
- 04_ros_tf
- 05_ros_slam_demo

All the ros packages are in `ros_tutorial_code/ros_tutorial_ws/src`

For each package, I have corresponding `readme.md` for you to follow.

The structure of this tutorial is: 

```shell
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── ros_tutorial_ws
    ├── build
    ├── devel
    └── src
        ├── 01_ros_basic
        ├── 02_rostopics
        ├── 03_ros_param_launch_bag
        ├── 04_ros_tf
        ├── 05_ros_slam_demo
        └── CMakeLists.txt
```

Please remember, you need to compile the package before you can see `build` and `devel`. And you cannot use ROS package before you compile it first. 

Please check your understanding after you finish each section:
